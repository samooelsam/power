         We are passionate about what we do & constantly search for ways to save our customers’ money &
         assist them in achieving their carbon reduction goals, including working towards CEMARS accreditation.







         By using synchronising technology & the latest generators, we can design & install a system with the
         emphasis on fuel & carbon footprint reduction.

         John F Hunt Power is currently demonstrating considerable fuel savings for our customers by utilising
         synchronised generator technology, for example:



         was high during peak demand, but reduced at night such that we were able to utilise a smaller
         generator set.
