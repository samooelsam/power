GreenD+ HVO is an enhancement of HVO, achieved by inclusion of an additive system which         chemically reduces NOx (to N2) in the exhaust gases, whilst oxidizing incomplete combustion         products (HC, PM and CO).          John F Hunt Power’s fuel is formulated as GreenD+ and then further enhanced with an additive         package to produce GreenD+ HVO.           The base HVO is sourced from two European companies including the world’s leading supplier of         renewable diesel.           GreenD+ HVO is utilised in the off-road and mobile plant industries. It has been widely adopted         in the UK as a drop-in diesel replacement by centrally fueled on-road and off-road fleets, marine         and in back-up power applications where it helps to meet the new MCPD requirements.          GreenD+ HVO has been adopted as our solution to meet clients environmental obligations.
