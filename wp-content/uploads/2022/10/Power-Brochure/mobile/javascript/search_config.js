added safety features           John F Hunt Power also stock a range of generators with a bespoke “HazSpec“ specification to          combat the serious safety risk of operating diesel generators in hazardous or explosive environments.           Chalwyn valves and spark arrestors have been factory fitted to our          John F Hunt Power specification Fusteq generators to create our          exclusive “HazSpec“ units.           On these HazSpec generators, the chalwyn valve blocks the air          intake system, cutting off all air intake along with potential external          fuel sources; whilst the spark arrestors prevent the emission of          flammable debris from the engine.            500 kVA HazSpec Generator              Standby   Prime   Fuel Tank   Fuel (L/H)   dBA    Size     Wet             Power   Power   Capacity   Consumption @   @   L x W x H  Weight             kVA      kVA             50%     75%    100%  7m  (mm)   (kg)                                                              5000              550     500      2000    45    72   96   62     2100    10400                                                              2400            800 kVA HazSpec Generator              Standby   Prime   Fuel Tank   Fuel (L/H)   dBA    Size     Wet             Power   Power   Capacity   Consumption @   @   L x W x H  Weight             kVA      kVA             50%     75%    100%  7m  (mm)   (kg)                                                              5850              880     800      1700    86   122   162  61     2280    13400                                                              2400           1260 kVA HazSpec Generator              Standby   Prime   Fuel Tank   Fuel (L/H)   dBA    Size     Wet             Power   Power   Capacity   Consumption @   @   L x W x H  Weight             kVA      kVA             50%     75%    100%  7m  (mm)   (kg)                                                            20’ High             1375     1260     2000    112  172   234  62    Cube     19500                                                            Container","BGG LED Lighting Towers                                                   BGG LED                                               Our modern, eco-friendly LED Lighting Towers combine the latest                                              mobile lighting technology, with the numerous advantages that                                              powerful LED lighting offers.

This latest offering will allow our clients to simultaneously reduce their fuel usage, whilst lowering the          environmental impact of their power supply.           By using our Flybrid 200 units in conjunction with our diesel generators, we’re able to offer a new solution          which allows for considerable generator downsizing in many applications.            Historically, generators have been sized to suit the peak, start-up load demand when used in applications          such as:           •      Tower Cranes          •      Pumps          •      Hoists          •      Medical Scanners etc           With loads of this nature, which have a substantial demand for power on start-up, generators are often          left to run at low load factors, for long periods of time, resulting in poor fuel economy and engine          performance.           Now, by using our Flybrid units, generators can be downsized          to provide more economical running after start-up, reduced          fuel usage and much improved carbon credentials.","How does it work?                                                          Flybrid units, contain cutting edge, flywheel energy storage technology and deliver an ultra-fast power          injection for smooth and controlled generator loading.           On start-up, when the requirement for load is significantly higher, both generator and Flybrid unit work in          conjunction to provide the required power.           Once the demand drops off, the generator runs as a standalone unit and the Flybrid regenerates in          preparation for the next peak requirement.","What are the results?                  We have carried out significant testing across a number of major projects, assessing the product on live          applications across different sectors.            Amongst our testing, we applied a Flybrid unit to a tower crane set up for a major construction client in the          Midlands.           A 300 kVA generator would usually be required to power the crane in question, however, we supplied a          150 kVA set and Flybrid unit with great success.              The client experienced the same reliable power supply whilst benefiting from a considerably reduced fuel          consumption and environmental impact.

Together with the environmental benefits associated with a drastic reduction in fuel usage, our Flybrid          package provided the perfect solution for our client’s project.","Hybrid Generators                                                     Hybrid Generator Cygnus 3                                                   Prime     Standby    Transfer  Standby  Battery   Size   Wet                                                  Power     Power      Relay     Power    Capacity  (mm)  Weight                                                 Rating @  Rating @ 25 C    Time  Consump.  kWh            (kg)                                                                  O                                                   25 C     30 mins               (W)    (60% DoD)                                                    O                                                  (kVA)                                                                                                   L 2050                                                    21      24 kVA    < 15 mins   7.2       48     W 998   2900                                                                                                   H 1500                                                Hybrid Generator Cygnus 4                                                    Prime     Standby    Transfer  Standby  Battery   Size   Wet                                                  Power     Power      Relay     Power   capacity  (mm)   Weight                                                 Rating @  Rating @ 25 C    Time  Consump.  @ 25 c,        (kg)                                                                  O                                                                                             o                                                   25 C     30 mins               (W)    C20 kWh                                                    O                                                  (kVA)                                  (80% DoD)                                                                                                   L 3000                                                    42      48 kVA    < 15 mins   30        90     W 1200  5900                                                                                                   H 1900          Our powerful Hybrid generators provide a pioneering solution for temporary power requirements.

From the simplest of procedures such as dedicated site visits to ensure the generator is correctly sized for          its application, to the implementation of fuel saving techniques, we are constantly striving to find          efficiencies for our customers.           By using synchronising technology \& the latest generators, we can design \& install a system with the          emphasis on fuel \& carbon footprint reduction.           John F Hunt Power is currently demonstrating considerable fuel savings for our customers by utilising          synchronised generator technology, for example:           A customer required a 500 kVA generator for a construction project  running 24 hours. Power requirement          was high during peak demand, but reduced at night such that we were able to utilise a smaller          generator set.           The two units  communicating together, allowed the  larger set to shut down whilst a smaller 100 kVA          generator covered the lower load requirement. This reduced noise pollution, fuel consumption \& carbon          output.           We further enhanced the efficiency of this site by providing GreenD+ HVO fuel management service,          details of which can be found in our GreenD+ HVO brochure.","Support and Transport               The key to high quality service has always been excellent support.
